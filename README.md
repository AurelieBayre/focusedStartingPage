# focusedStartingPage
a starting page for my browser customized to help me stay focused.


## Achieved:

1. setting up the layout (master branch)
2. creating a form to get user settings (name, goal, deadline) (master branch and gettingUserInput branch)
3. store those data in localstorage (storingUserData branch)
4. calculate remaining days before deadline. (master branch)
5. populating page with user data. (gettingUserData branch)
6. setting another form to get priority item and priority item url. (storingPrioritiesDB)
7. setting up an IndexedDB store to store objects for each new priority (storingPrioritiesDB)
8. see why indexdb doesn't work with firefox and fix it. (debugFirefoxDB) (Spoiler: in fact it works but firefox doesn't display the db in the console tools.)

## Todo:

* populate page from IndexDB
* add a trash icon + complete icon
* set rules for trashed or completed item
